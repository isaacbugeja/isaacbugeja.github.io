                <p>Hello there! I'm a 24-year-old IT support engineer with a strong passion for continuous learning and
                    personal growth. When I'm not troubleshooting technical issues, I'm often found at the gym, where
                    I've recently taken up powerlifting as a new challenge.</p>

                    knowledge base and enhancing my capabilities.</p>

                <p>Currently, I'm focused on advancing my programming skills with the goal of transitioning into a
                    software development role. Whether I'm coding innovative applications, experimenting with recipes,
                    or learning musical instruments, I'm always eager to broaden my horizons.</p>
